      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>fiwse2014 (fantasy international winter sporting event 2014) is a salary-cap fantasy sports game based around a popular quadrennial cold-weather sports competition.<p>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>Participating nations have been assigned values based on past competition performance. Choose <b>5 nations</b>, whose combined cost does not exceed <b>$100.00</b> for your team. Each country earns points according to the following formula:</p>
      <blockquote>(300*<i>gold medals</i> + 200*<i>silver medals</i> + 100*<i>bronze medals</i>) / <i>number of competing athletes</i></blockquote>
      <p>Your team can be updated at any time up to <b>February 6, 2014 (UTC)</b> at which point all rosters will be locked.</p>
      <p>Point totals and standings will be updated regularly during the competition with the team(s) achieving the highest point total at the end of the competition being declared <b>victorious</b> and maybe winning certificates of accomplishment.</p>
      <h3>Reference</h3>
      <p>Official statistics and results will come from Wikipedia. That's right. Wikipedia. Specifically:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics</a></blockquote>
      <p>The raw data used to determine the nation pricing is available here:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiamJ-YKiQO_dG5PQjFZUXZQb3hPYVBXSGlUUnI4bFE&usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiamJ-YKiQO_dG5PQjFZUXZQb3hPYVBXSGlUUnI4bFE&usp=sharing</a></blockquote>
      <p>Pricing is finalized; however, the number of competing athletes per country will be updated at the start of the games with the actual number of competing athletes used to determine earned points.</p>
      <p>Good luck bargain hunting!</p>
